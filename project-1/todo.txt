- preprocessing: implement methods in preprocess script
- RYAN

- loss functions: have to implement two

	- should save results in pandas data frame for easy reference
- BRANDON

- develop hypothesis on what data scrambling impact will be
	- write out hypothesis section of report

- run experiments: get results, put into report as tables
	- run naive bayes on all cross-validation combinations
	- run naive bayes on all scrambled CV combinations

- write report
- ALL
