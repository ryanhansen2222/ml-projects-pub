ALGORITHM COMPARISONS


GENETIC ALGORITHMS VS BACKPROPAGATION


"However, the BP algorithm suffers from a number of problems. It is very
often trapped in local minima and is very inefficient in searching for global minimum of the search space."

"GAS have the potential to produce a global minimum of the weight space and thereby avoid local minima."

"When nearly global minima are well hidden among the local minima, backpropagation can end up bouncing
between local minima without much overall improvement, thus leading tor very slow training."

DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION VS GRADIENT BASED METHODS (BACKPROP)


"DE performance typically comparable to gradient based methods - no distinct advantage over gradient based methods"

EVOLUTION VS BACKPROP


	- evolutionary strategies don't need differentiable activation functions
