NOTES on Genetic Algorithms


OVERVIEW


	- we can use genetic algorithm to learn the best combinations of hyperparameters for a neural net
	- can use to learn neural net weights as well

	- genome in this context is a particular set of hyperparameters for a neural net

	- GA evolves multiple solutions over the course of multiple generations
	- single solution in GA will contain all weights/biases for single network
	- all weights/biases in network will be represented with a single 1-dimensional vector (the chromosome)

	- each solution in population will have two representations:
		- list of weight matrices and bias vectors, used in neural network
		- single 1D vector containing all weights/biases, used in genetic algorithm
		- need to be able to easily convert between the two forms (with a dedicated method)

	- common fitness function is accuracy
