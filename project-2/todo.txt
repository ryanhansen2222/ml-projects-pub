QUESTIONS:

is the Design Document supposed to be a LaTeX file?


TASKS:

- design application architecture
- decide major design designs, record in notes
- create UML diagram for application architecture
- create Design Document with all the things


- write code

	Algorithms:
	- implement k-NN using entire training set
	- implement edited k-NN using entire training set
	- implement condensed k-NN using entire training set
	- implement k-means clustering and use cluster centroids as reduced data set for k-NN
	- implement Partitioning Around Medoids for k-medoids clustering and use medoids as reduced data set for k-NN

	Execution:
	- test each of the k-NN algorithms using at least 5 different values for k (tuning)
	- when clustering, set k to equal the number of points returned from both edited NN and condensed NN


- write contributions file for code contributions of each team member


- develop hypothesis on performance of each algorithm against the various data sets


- write a paper that incorporates the following elements, summarizing the results of your experiments:
	- (a) title and author name
	- (b) A brief, one paragraph abstract summarizing the results of the experiments
	- (c) Problem statement, including hypothesis
	- (d) Description of algorithms implemented
	- (e) Description of your experimental approach
	- (f) Presentation of the results of your experiments
	- (g) A discussion of the behavior of your algorithms, combined with any conclusions you can draw
	- (h) Summary
	- (i) References
			- one reference related to each of the algorithms implemented 
			- and any other eferences you consider to be relevant
			- you should also provide a reference for each of the data sets
				- you may not reference websites except for the data sets


- make demo video
	- show intermediate steps of algorithms as they run
		- i.e. print out intermediate steps of the actual algorithm calculation
	- don't bother showing code at all...
