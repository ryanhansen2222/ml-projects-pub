APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE:

three classification data sets and three regression data sets
 - explain design of instance-based methods for handling each
 - explain experimental design as well

DataApi class for accessing data sets

DATA:
- classification data sets:
	- abalone
	- car evaluation
	- image segmentation
- regression data sets:
	- computer hardware
	- forest fires
	- wine quality

Preprocessor class for preprocessing of data sets, handle missing values - removal or data imputation
- find min and max boundaries automatically i.o. provide them manually
- create general functions to apply for preprocessing data sets (don't have dedicated functions)

Algorithms:
- implement k-NN using entire training set
- implement edited k-NN using entire training set
- implement condensed k-NN using entire training set
- implement k-means clustering and use cluster centroids as reduced data set for k-NN
- implement Partitioning Around Medoids for k-medoids clustering and use medoids as reduced data set for k-NN

Execution:
- test each of the k-NN algorithms using at least 5 different values for k (tuning)
- when clustering, set k to equal the number of points returned from both edited NN and condensed NN

ParameterTuner class for tuning hyperparameters of various algorithms
